### Crossover Suggestions
- Change the navigation bar so that the buttons are the same for each page (as there are currently different buttons on some of the pages), to prevent confusion 
- Maybe try thinking about using jinja and CSS to make it a bit easier on the formatting and make website navigation easier for the user

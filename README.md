##Project Idea
- We are going for an information website about topics that people would find interesting. 
- One main idea is an industry news website that gives readers the latest news on what is happening in certain industries, such as Hollywood and the music industry.
- Another idea that we had was a virtual museum for some kind of history, such as art, music, or even gaming. We would show a chronological progression of the genre using images and examples from the time frame.
